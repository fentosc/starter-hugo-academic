abstract: How important is historical persistence in explaining observed economic growth? Drawing on 40 years of panel data on Indonesian manufacturing plants, we show that initial conditions in 1975, characterized by small plants and a missing right-tail, are highly predictive of future growth dynamics. To disentangle the role of initial conditions from other main drivers of plant dynamics and quantify its importance, we build a structural model of non-stationary plant dynamics that closely matches observed growth dynamics. We find that initial conditions account for 20% of observed growth, compared to technologyâ€™s 60% - the main driver in standard models. Importantly, we find that initial conditions do not become less important over time. The reason is that initial conditions induce only a slow transition to a new stationary distribution due to the presence of sizable frictions, while changes in entry and aggregate technology continuously create new potential for growth.

What explains growth miracles? We look at this question through the lens of a model of plant dynamics where periods of rapid economic growth are driven by aggregate changes in the economic environment and catch-up growth. 

The model features a time-varying growth path with endogenous structural change across sectors, the frictional
accumulation and reallocation of labor and capital across plants, and productivity growth through the endogenous selection of plants and exogenous changes in technology.

Building on 40 years of plant-level manufacturing panel data for Indonesia, we show how to tractably estimate the model on the micro data along the observed growth path without assuming that the economy is at a steady state. 

Transition growth from initial conditions in 1975 accounts for 42 percent of Indonesia's subsequent industrialization. But transition growth does not become less important over time because further changes in worker and plant demographics induce new adjustments. 

Observed changes in government policy explain few changes in worker and plant demographics and thus drive at most 10% of observed economic growth.
