New transport infrastructure may directly affect a country by decreasing trade costs between locations but also indirectly through changes in locations characteristics such as their firm composition. 

In this paper, we quantify both channels. Using data from Mexico, we empirically show that firms close to newly built highways increase their productivity and employment, and reduce their exit rates. 

We then propose and estimate a spatial general equilibrium model with internal trade and firm dynamics to show, first, that new transportation infrastructure increases welfare and income; second, that income gains are unequally distributed across the country; and third, that endogenous changes in the firm composition explain up to half the income gains.
