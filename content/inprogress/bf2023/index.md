This paper studies how improvements in the highways network affect firm dynamics and the geographical distribution of economic activity. 
 
To do this, we use firm-level panel data from Mexico and a the plausible exogenous variation generated by the timing of execution of presidential construction plans. We find that firms experience a 2\% increase in productivity, 2\% increase in size and 2pp lower exit rates as a result of better transportation infrastructure. We don't find significant effects on entry. 
 
To model this interaction between transportation infrastructure and firm dynamics, we extend the Allen and Arkolakis (201) model to account for firm entry, exit and growth in the spirit of Hopenhayn (1992). Using our calibrated model to match the distribution of wages, labor and firms in Mexico, we demonstrate that the benefits of improved infrastructure were not uniformly distributed across the country. Locations with lower relative exposure lost firms and employment to better-exposed locations, particularly those located near seaports or the US. These heterogeneous effects imply 20\% smaller welfare gains than what standard static models predict. 
 
Overall, our findings highlight the importance of transportation infrastructure for firm dynamics, and the potential for an uneven distribution of benefits.
