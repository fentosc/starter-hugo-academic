New transport infrastructure decreases trade costs, which increases overall economic activity but also leads to spatial reallocation. A key overlooked channel is that changes in trade costs also change incentives of firms to enter, exit and produce, driving endogenous changes in local productivity. 

In this paper, we show that endogenous firm dynamics are key to understand how infrastructure drives economic activity. We do this in two steps. First, using data from Mexico and leveraging on a natural experiment, we show that after new highways are built, firms increase their productivity and size while also reducing their exit rates. In the medium run, these effects persist along with higher entry rates. 

Second, motivated by this evidence, we propose and estimate a spatial general equilibrium model with internal trade and firm dynamics. Our model shows that new transport infrastructure increases welfare and real income. However, real income gains are unequally distributed across the country because of heterogeneous exposure and productivity gains. We measure that up to half the income gains from infrastructure are explained by local productivity growth primarily driven by endogenous firm selection.
