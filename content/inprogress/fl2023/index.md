abstract: Total Factor Productivity fell in Mexico since the early 1990s despite reforms to increase efficiency including participation in the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and the United States; contrary to expectations, there was productivity divergence. We exploit a rich firm database to understand this outcome. We construct a twenty year panel and analyze firm dynamics from two complementary perspectives, formality status and sector composition. In the first case we show that firm dynamics were dysfunctional**:** high productivity firms exited, surviving ones did not become more productive, and entrants were less productive than survivors, mostly because of informality. In the second we show that while manufactures performed relatively better, its contribution to TFP was very modest because, despite Nafta, informal entry into the sector persisted. We document that for TFP, the formal informal composition of the economy is more important than its sector composition. We show that surviving firms grew very little and that more informalized than formalized. A back of the envelope calculation shows that absent informality, Mexico would have narrowed the productivity gap with its Nafta partners. Our results shed light on the impacts of trade reforms in economies with large informality.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: TFP  fell in Mexico since the 1990's despite NAFTA. We argue that this was explained by dysfunctional firm dynamics. High productivity firms exited, surviving ones did not become more productive, and entrants were less productive than survivors, mostly because of informality. Our results shed light on the impacts of trade reforms in economies with large informality.

Total Factor Productivity fell in Mexico since the early 1990s despite reforms to increase efficiency including participation in the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and the United States; contrary to expectations, there was productivity divergence. 

We exploit a rich firm database to understand this outcome. We construct a twenty year panel and analyze firm dynamics from two complementary perspectives, formality status and sector composition. In the first case we show that firm dynamics were dysfunctional: high productivity firms exited, surviving ones did not become more productive, and entrants were less productive than survivors, mostly because of informality. In the second we show that while manufactures performed relatively better, its contribution to TFP was very modest because, despite Nafta, informal entry into the sector persisted. We document that for TFP, the formal informal composition of the economy is more important than its sector composition. We show that surviving firms grew very little and that more informalized than formalized. 

A back of the envelope calculation shows that absent informality, Mexico would have narrowed the productivity gap with its Nafta partners. Our results shed light on the impacts of trade reforms in economies with large informality.
